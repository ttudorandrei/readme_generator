# Title

Professional Readme Generator

## Description

As a developer, I was tasked with building a professional README.md Generator.

When the user runs the script, he will be prompted with a set of questions.

Navigating through that set of questions, he is able to choose the name and extension of the readme file as well as the content or the presence of a screenshot section.

Upon answering all questions, a file will be generated, containing all of the inputs the user typed in.

## Getting Started

- clone repository into your machine
- cd into repository
- run `npm install` in node
- to run the script simply type in the terminal `node` and the name of the script you want ro run, in this case `node index.js`
